              <p>Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to Asia. After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world.</p>

              <h2>The History of Tea</h2>
              <img src="https://www.fast-growing-trees.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/iStock_000033651106_Large.jpg" = title="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=0ahUKEwjbgKn_3b3SAhUG_WMKHU7eBYkQjhwIBQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fast-growing-trees.com%2Fblog%2Ftea-plants-are-cold-hardy-and-easy-to-grow%2F&bvm=bv.148747831,d.cGc&psig=AFQjCNEaYFeg8IrRM_hKFb9q8akCtf_3Tg&ust=1488747292327456">
              <p>The story of tea begins in China. According to legend, in 2737 BC, the Chinese emperor Shen Nung was sitting beneath a tree while his servant boiled drinking water, when some leaves from the tree blew into the water. ... The tree was a Camellia sinensis, and the resulting drink was what we now call tea.</p>

            <h2>White Tea</h2>
            <img src="https://greymountainherbs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Silver-Needle-White-Tea.png" title="https://greymountainherbs.com/product/silver-needle-white-tea/">
            <p>White tea is tea made from new growth buds and young leaves of the plant Camellia sinensis. The leaves are steamed or fried to inactivate oxidation, and then dried. White tea therefore retains the high concentrations of catechins which are present in fresh tea leaves.</p>

          <h2>Green Tea</h2>
          <img src="http://simplymatchatea.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Matcha-leaves-300x267.png" title="http://www.ramweb.org/green-tea-leaves-png.html">
          <p>Green tea is a type of tea leaves that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation process used to make oolong and black tea.</p>

        <h2>Black Tea</h2>
        <img src="http://sunnyislandtea.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/black-brown-bag-package-04.png" title="http://sunnyislandtea.com/product/black-tea-by-sunny-island-tea-co-brown-bag-package">
        <p>Black tea is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, green and white teas. Black tea is generally stronger in flavor than the less oxidized teas.</p>

          <h2>Oolong Tea</h2>
          <img src="http://hatvala.com/hatvalacoffe/images/Teas/Oolong/Leaves-FOT.gif" title="http://hatvala.com/hatvalacoffe/teas-vietnam/oolong-tea-vietnam">
          <p>Oolong is a traditional Chinese tea (Camellia sinensis) produced through a process including withering the plant under strong sun and oxidation before curling and twisting.</p>
